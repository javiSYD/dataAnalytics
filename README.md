# dataAnalytics

This repository contains my data projects that I have worked on that display my technical and business skills. The projects include an analysis of Internet Poverty & Education, a study of Airbnb, a hot project with Tinder among others. 

I performed exploratory data analysis, built regression models, and made recommendations based on my findings. My deliverables included presentations, Jupyter Notebooks, and blog posts. My technical skills include Python, SQL, Mongo, and Excel. My business skills include problem solving, critical thinking, and data-driven decision making. 

By displaying my technical and business skills through these projects, I am confident in my ability to be a successful Data Analyst.
